The subway would be leased to the IRT (Interborough Rapid Transit company), a name still known by older New Yorkers to this day. This subway line would run from City Hall to 145th Street and would be referred to as "City Hall to Harlem in 15 Minutes" allowing New Yorkers to commute and explore further out of the city.

The IND was made with full intent to compete and hopefully run the other two companies out of business in order to take over and unite the subway systems.</p>

                    <p class="expand-info">By 1940, the IND successfully bought out the privately owned BMT and IRT for $317 million, succeeding in gaining access to all the subway systems throughout the city. Several BMT and IND routes were connected due to them sharing similar route designs regarding stations and tunnels. This would be known as the B division. The IRT remained alone and separated in the A division due to their smaller stations, narrower tunnels and sharper curves that were unable to house the B division rolling stock. In order to connect both divisions, stations were instead connected by having passengers walk from a route to another without having to pay another fare similar to how Times Square has most of the city's trains within walking distance underground.</p>

                    <p class="expand-info">In the 1970s-1980s, the NYC subway struggled to maintain high ridership and keep its crime and vandalism low. Delays and poor maintenance also contributed to passengers seeking out other transportation options. Hundreds of felonies were committed on the subway system each week during the 1980s. However, the NYCTA pressed on under lead of David Gunn, president of the NYCTA, opening several new subway stations, ordering hundreds of new subway cars and cleaned up the graffiti-ridden rolling stock. NYC's police force joined as well in order to combat crime and make the subway a safe place again. Going into the 1990s, ridership began to rise and subway conditions began to climb once again.</p>

With the goal of making fare collection automated and less tedious, stations everywhere were updated with MetroCard compatible turnstiles, speeding up the entrance process and cutting costs due to tokens costing more to operate with. Tokens were eventually fully phased out by 2003.</p>

                    <p class="expand-info">In the 1990s, the MTA began to experiment with communications-based train control (CBTC), a system that allowed more trains to operate on the tracks by improving communication. Although initially implemented only on the BMT Canarsie line, it has been added to several other lines through the next two decades. The MTA also started to add digital displays on the train stations to display when the trains would arrive as well as help stations for assistance and emergencies. In 2011, Travel Station kiosks were installed giving city natives and tourists alike a one stop shop for information on the subway, navigation and city information.</p>

Metrocards are slated to be phased out by 2024, replaced by the widely used OMNY system where passengers can simply tap their credit cards for access. All subway lines should be updated with CBTC as well as newer rolling stock with better features such as open gangways, digital displays and lighted doorways. Ridership is still heavily decreased in the wake of COVID-19 but is slowly climbing back up. We will just have to see how the MTA can continue to work on and hopefully improve the subway system for the millions of New Yorkers that ride it daily.</p>

            <p>This website was made in order to go through some of the history of the NYC Subway, starting from the first system made under the IRT to the sprawling, widespread system we have now. Eventually an idea I have is to go more into individual lines and how they progressed from their inception to how they are now. This is also one of my first big attempts at using javascript to heavily manipulate the DOM and make the page more interactive. I would love to add more animations and effects as I learn more.</p>
